    This site is still currently under development. Ideally, this would replace the 
    multiple steps needed for the current equipment checkout process. A calendar is
    currently in the works that should replace the Outlook calendar. For reliability's
    sake, it would be good to still create tickets in ServiceNow and then copy them
    here until this is a bug-free platform.

    This Equipment Checkout interface should be able to keep track of how many of each
    type of equipment is checked out in order to ensure that we don't overbook equipment.
